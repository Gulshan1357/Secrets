# Secrets

This application let the user log in and submit their secrets anonymously. I build this web app to get familier with the different levels of Authenication and Security.


**Levels:**
1. Change the text-type of sensitive data in html file to password
2. Database Encryption
3. Hashing Password
4. Salting and Hashing Passwords with bcrypt
5. Using Passport.js to add cookies and sessions.
6. OAuth 2.0 and how to log in using google.
